.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ntopng
shows the current network usage. It displays a list of hosts that are
currently using the network and reports information concerning the (IP and non-IP)
traffic generated and received by each host.
.B ntopng
may operate as a front-end collector or as a stand-alone collector/display program.
A web browser is needed to access the information captured by the
.B ntopng
program.

.B ntopng
is a hybrid layer 2 / layer 3 network monitor, by default it uses the layer 2 Media
Access Control (MAC) addresses AND the layer 3 tcp/ip addresses.
.B ntopng
is capable of associating the two, so that ip and non-ip traffic (e.g. arp, rarp) are combined
for a complete picture of network activity.

.SH OPTIONS

.It filename
The text of
.B filename
is copied \(em ignoring line breaks and comment lines (anything following a #) \(em into the
command line.
.B ntopng
behaves as if all of the text had simply been typed directly on the command line.
For example, if the command line is "ntopng s.conf" and file s.conf contains
just the line '\-s', then the effective command line is "ntopng \-s".
In case you use a configuration file, the following options on the command line
will be ignored. Example "ntopng /etc/ntopng/ntopng.conf \-v" the \-v option is ignored.

The configuration file is similar to the command line, with the exception that an equal
sign '=' must be used between key and value. Example:
\-i=p1p2
or
\-\-interface=p1p2
For options with no value (e.g. \-v) the equal is also necessary. Example: "\-v=" must be used.

Remember, most
.B ntopng
options are "sticky", that is they just set an internal flag. Invoking
them multiple times doesn't change the
.B ntopng's
behavior. However, options that set a value, such as \-\-trace\-level, will use the LAST value
given: \-w 8000 \-w 8080 will run as \-w 8080.

.It \-n|\-\-dns\-mode
Sets the DNS address resolution mode:
.br
0 \(em Decode DNS responses and resolve only local (\-m) numeric IPs
.br
1 \(em Decode DNS responses and resolve all numeric IPs
.br
2 \(em Decode DNS responses and don't resolve numeric IPs
.br
3 \(em Don't decode DNS responses and don't resolve numeric IPs

.It \-i|\-\-interface
Specifies the network interface or collector endpoint to be used by
.B ntopng
for network monitoring. On Unix you can specify both the interface name (e.g. lo)
or the numeric interface id as shown by ntopng \-h. On Windows you must use
the interface number instead. Note that you can specify \-i multiple times in order
to instruct
.B ntopng
to create multiple interfaces.

If a collector endpoint is specified,
.B ntopng
open a ZeroMQ connection to the specified endpoint as a subscriber whose format
is  <ZMQ endpoint>. Example of valid collector endpoints are "tcp://127.0.0.1:5556" or ipc://flows.ipc
Note that you can specify multiple endpoint, commas separated list, in order
to instruct
.B ntopng
to aggregate it in a single interface. (e.g \-i tcp://127.0.0.1:5556,ipc://flows.ipc)

If you want you can pass a path of a pcap file (e.g. \-i dummy.pcap) or a path of a list file contains a path of a pcap file for each line (e.g. \-i pcap.list) and ntopng will read packets from the specified pcap file/s.

.B nProbe
can be instructed to act as a publisher delivering flows to a ZeroMQ endpoint using the \-\-ZMQ <endpoint> parameter.

.It \-d|\-\-data\-dir
Specifies the data directory (it must be writable). Default directory is /var/tmp/data

.It \-G|\-\-pid\-path
Specifies the path where the PID (process ID) is saved. Default is /var/tmp/ntopng.pid

.It \-H|\-\-disable\-alerts
Disable the generation of alerts.

.It \-k| \-\-httpbl\-key <key>
Set the key used to access httpbl services (default: disabled).  Please read README.httpbl for more info.

.It \-c|\-\-categorization\-key
Sets the key used to access host categorization services.
.B ntopng
categorizes hosts using services provided by http://block.si
In order to use these categorization services you need to mail info@block.si and
ask for a test key to be used in ntopng.
For test driving the service please use as key 9hoAtewwpC2tXRMJBfifrY24B
(example ntopng \-c 9hoAtewwpC2tXRMJBfifrY24B .....).

.It \-e|\-\-daemon
This parameter causes ntop to become a daemon, i.e. a task which runs in the background without connection to a specific terminal. To use ntop other than as a casual monitoring tool, you probably will want to use this option.

.It \-w|\-\-http\-port
Sets the HTTP port of the embedded web server. If set to 0, the http server will be disable.

.It \-W|\-\-https\-port
Sets the HTTPS port of the embedded web server. If not set, it will be set to the value of \-w plus one.

.It \-m|\-\-local\-networks
.B ntopng
determines the ip addresses and netmasks for each active interface. Any traffic on
those networks is considered local. This parameter allows the user to define additional
networks and subnetworks whose traffic is also considered local in
.B ntopng
reports. All other hosts are considered remote. If not specified the default is
set to 192.168.1.0/24.

Commas separate multiple network values.
Both netmask and CIDR notation may be used, even mixed together, for instance
"131.114.21.0/24,10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0".

.It \-p|\-\-ndpi\-protocols
This parameter is used to specify a nDPI protocol file.
The format is <tcp|udp>:<port>,<tcp|udp>:<port>,.....@<proto> where
<port> is a port number and <proto> is a name of a protocol supported by nDPI protocol,
or host:"<string>"@<proto> where string is part of an host name.
As example see https://svn.ntop.org/svn/ntop/trunk/nDPI/example/protos.txt

.It \-P|\-\-disable\-host\-persistency
Disable host persistency.

.It \-q|\-\-disable\-autologout
Disable web interface logout for inactivity.

.It \-l|\-\-disable\-login
Disable user login. This is useful for debug purposes or if you want to let everyone access the web gui.

.It \-r|\-\-redis
Specifies the redis database host and port. For more information about redis, please refer
to http://redis.io/.

.It \-U|\-\-user
Run ntopng with the specified system user instead of 'nobody'.

.It \-s|\-\-dont\-change\-user
Do not change user (debug only).

.It \-B|\-\-packet\-filter
Specifies the packet filter for the specified interface. For pcap/PF_RING interfaces
the filter has to be specified in BPF format (Berkeley Packet Filter).

.It \-C|\-\-dump\-timeline
Enable timeline dump on disk (default: disabled).

.It \-A|\-\-enable\-aggregations <mode>
Enable data aggregations (e.g. Operating System, DNS etc). The available modes are:
.br
0  \(em Disable aggregations, default
.br
1  \(em Enable aggregations but do not dump on disk their activity timeline
.br
2  \(em Enable aggregations and timeline dump on disk.

.It \-X|\-\-max\-num\-flows
Specify the maximum number of active flows that ntopng will handle. If more flows are
detected they will be discarded.

.It \-x|\-\-max\-num\-hosts
Specify the maximum number of active hosts that ntopng will handle. If more hosts are
detected they will be discarded.

.It \-F|\-\-dump\-flows
If ntopng is compiled with sqlite support, flows can dumped persistently on disk using this option.
Databases are created daily under <data directory>/<interface>/db. Using this option you can reload the dumped flows via the Historical Interface specify the time interval and the interface.

.It \-D|\-\-dump\-hosts
If ntopng is compiled with sqlite support, hosts contacts can dumped persistently on disk using this option.
Databases are created daily under <data directory>/<interface>/contacts. This options supports three dump
modes: local (dumps only local hosts), remote (dumps only remote hosts), all (dumps all hosts). If not
specified, no hosts are dumped to disk.

.It \-I|\-\-export\-flows
Export the expired flows on the specified endpoint. For instance supposing to start ntopng on host
1.2.3.4 as ntopng \-I "tcp://*:3456", it exports flows on this endpoint so that you can create a
hierarchy of ntopng's. You can achieve that by starting a collector ntopng as
ntopng \-i tcp://1.2.3.4:3456

.It \-E|\-\-dump\-aggregations
If ntopng is compiled with sqlite support, hosts contacts can dumped persistently on disk using this option.
Databases are created daily under <data directory>/<interface>/contacts. This options supports three dump
modes: local (dumps only aggregations contacted by local hosts), remote (dumps only aggregations contacted by
remote hosts), all (dumps all aggregations). If not specified, no hosts are dumped to disk.

.It \-S|\-\-sticky\-hosts
ntopng periodically purges idle hosts. With this option you can modify this behaviour by telling ntopng
not to purge the hosts specified by \-S. This parameter requires an argument that can be "all" (Keep all hosts in memory),
"local" (Keep only local hosts), "remote" (Keep only remote hosts), "none" (Flush hosts when idle).

.It \-\-json\-labels
Using this option in case JSON label is used (e.g. with ZMQ/Sqlite) labels instead of numbers are used as keys.

.It \-\-hw\-timestamp\-mode
Enable hw timestamping/stripping. Supported TS modes are:
.br
ixia \(em Timestamped packets by ixiacom.com hardware devices .

.It \-v|\-\-verbose
Verbose tracing.

.It \-V|\-\-version
Print
.B ntopng
version and quit.

.It \-h|\-\-help
Help

.SH "WEB VIEWS"
While
.B ntopng
is running, multiple users can access the traffic information using their web browsers.
.B ntopng
makes use of JavaScript and LESS CSS.

We do not expect problems with any current web browser, but our ability to test with less
common ones is very limited.  Testing has included Safari, Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer,
with very limited testing on other current common browsers such as Opera.

.SH NOTES
.B ntopng
requires a number of external tools and libraries to operate.
Certain other tools are optional, but add to the program's capabilities.

Required libraries include:

.B libpcap
from http://www.tcpdump.org/, version 1.0 or newer.

The Windows version makes use of
.B WinPcap
(libpcap for Windows) which may be downloaded from
http://winpcap.polito.it/install/default.htm.
.

.B ntopng
requires a POSIX threads library.
.

The
.B rrdtool
library creates 'Round-Robin databases' which are used to store historical data
in a format that permits long duration retention without growing larger over time.
The rrdtool home page is http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/

The
.B LuaJIT
library is a Just-In-Time Compiler for Lua used to execute GUI and periodic scripts.

The
.B mongoose
library is used to implement the HTTP server part of ntopng.

.B zeromq
is a socket library supporting the publish/subscribe pattern used to collect flows from
.B nProbe
.

.B ntopng
includes LuaJIT, mongoose, rrdtool and zeromq in the third-party/ directory.  Users of
.B ntopng
should not need to specifically install such libraries.
